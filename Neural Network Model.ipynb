    "In this notebook, we implement a Neural Network (NN) model for our problem. First, we test the model by varying the number of output layers, number of nodes in an output layer with ReLu and Sigmoid functions. We found that two layers with nine nodes in the middle layer and ReLu function are good choices for our NN model. When the model was tested we found that precesion, accuracy and recall is closer to 70% which is better than our baseline model results."
